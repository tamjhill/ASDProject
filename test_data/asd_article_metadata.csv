30545856,"Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.",2018,Science,10.1126/science.aat8127,"Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development."
31097668,Single-cell genomics identifies cell type-specific molecular changes in autism.,2019,Science,10.1126/science.aav8130,"Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of autism, bulk gene expression studies show that changes in the neocortex of autism patients converge on common genes and pathways. However, direct assessment of specific cell types in the brain affected by autism has not been feasible until recently. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from patients with autism to identify autism-associated transcriptomic changes in specific cell types. We found that synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons and the molecular state of microglia are preferentially affected in autism. Moreover, our results show that dysregulation of specific groups of genes in cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical severity of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes in upper-layer cortical circuits are linked to behavioral manifestations of autism."
33243861,In vivo Perturb-Seq reveals neuronal and glial abnormalities associated with autism risk genes.,2020,Science,10.1126/science.aaz6063,"The number of disease risk genes and loci identified through human genetic studies far outstrips the capacity to systematically study their functions. We applied a scalable genetic screening approach, in vivo Perturb-Seq, to functionally evaluate 35 autism spectrum disorder/neurodevelopmental delay (ASD/ND) de novo loss-of-function risk genes. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced frameshift mutations in these risk genes in pools, within the developing mouse brain in utero, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing of perturbed cells in the postnatal brain. We identified cell type-specific and evolutionarily conserved gene modules from both neuronal and glial cell classes. Recurrent gene modules and cell types are affected across this cohort of perturbations, representing key cellular effects across sets of ASD/ND risk genes. In vivo Perturb-Seq allows us to investigate how diverse mutations affect cell types and states in the developing organism."
36213201,Cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of neocortical circuit organization and their relevance to autism.,2022,Front Neural Circuits,10.3389/fncir.2022.982721,"A prevailing challenge in neuroscience is understanding how diverse neuronal cell types select their synaptic partners to form circuits. In the neocortex, major classes of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons are conserved across functionally distinct regions. There is evidence these classes form canonical circuit motifs that depend primarily on their identity; however, regional cues likely also influence their choice of synaptic partners. We mined the Allen Institute's single-cell RNA-sequencing database of mouse cortical neurons to study the expression of genes necessary for synaptic connectivity and physiology in two regions: the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the primary visual cortex (VISp). We used the Allen's metadata to parse cells by clusters representing major excitatory and inhibitory classes that are common to both ALM and VISp. We then performed two types of pairwise differential gene expression analysis: (1) between different neuronal classes within the same brain region (ALM or VISp), and (2) between the same neuronal class in ALM and VISp. We filtered our results for differentially expressed genes related to circuit connectivity and developed a novel bioinformatic approach to determine the sets uniquely enriched in each neuronal class in ALM, VISp, or both. This analysis provides an organized set of genes that may regulate synaptic connectivity and physiology in a cell-type-specific manner. Furthermore, it identifies candidate mechanisms for circuit organization that are conserved across functionally distinct cortical regions or that are region dependent. Finally, we used the SFARI Human Gene Module to identify genes from this analysis that are related to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our analysis provides clear molecular targets for future studies to understand neocortical circuit organization and abnormalities that underlie autistic phenotypes."

36688057,The Issue of Monocyte Activation in ASD: Troubles with Translation.,2022,J Cell Immunol,10.33696/immunology.4.146,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased year on year for the past two decades and currently affects 1 in 44 individuals in the US. An increasing number of studies have pointed to increased immune activation as both an etiological agent and also involved in the ongoing pathological process of ASD. Both adaptive and innate immune responses have been implicated. Evidence of innate dysregulation has so far included increased production of innate inflammatory cytokines, increased cell numbers, and altered activation in monocytes in the blood and microglia in the brain. Suggesting an orchestrated innate immune response may be involved in ASD. Hughes et al. (2022) recently assessed transcriptome differences that could underlie altered activation of monocytes using next-generation bulk-RNA sequencing on isolated CD14+ monocytes at baseline and after activation with different Toll-like receptor agonists. Circulating CD14+ monocyte from children with autistic disorder (AD) and children diagnosed with perverse developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) were found to differ in a number of activation pathways after gene enrichment analysis compared to typically developing children. There was an overall upregulation in translational machinery in both neurodevelopmental disorder groups, whereas typically developing children were downregulated, indicating an issue with monocyte activation. Several identified differentially expressed genes in monocytes were also identified as ASD at-risk genes, according to the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), and genes involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. This work implicates altered monocyte activation with a lack of regulation as a potential mechanistic issue in ASD. Future work is warranted to evaluate how monocyte regulatory mechanisms differ in ASD individuals."
37041460,Single-nucleus gene and gene set expression-based similarity network fusion identifies autism molecular subtypes.,2023,BMC Bioinformatics,10.1186/s12859-023-05278-0,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. With the accumulation of biological sequencing data, more and more studies shift to molecular subtype-first approach, from identifying molecular subtypes based on genetic and molecular data to linking molecular subtypes with clinical manifestation, which can reduce heterogeneity before phenotypic profiling.
RESULTS: In this study, we perform similarity network fusion to integrate gene and gene set expression data of multiple human brain cell types for ASD molecular subtype identification. Then we apply subtype-specific differential gene and gene set expression analyses to study expression patterns specific to molecular subtypes in each cell type. To demonstrate the biological and practical significance, we analyze the molecular subtypes, investigate their correlation with ASD clinical phenotype, and construct ASD molecular subtype prediction models.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified molecular subtype-specific gene and gene set expression may be used to differentiate ASD molecular subtypes, facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of ASD. Our method provides an analytical pipeline for the identification of molecular subtypes and even disease subtypes of complex disorders."
37381037,Exploratory analysis of L1 retrotransposons expression in autismï»¿.,2023,Mol Autism,10.1186/s13229-023-00554-5,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental diseases whose genetic etiology is not completely understood. Several investigations have relied on transcriptome analysis from peripheral tissues to dissect ASD into homogenous molecular phenotypes. Recently, analysis of changes in gene expression from postmortem brain tissues has identified sets of genes that are involved in pathways previously associated with ASD etiology. In addition to protein-coding transcripts, the human transcriptome is composed by a large set of non-coding RNAs and transposable elements (TEs). Advancements in sequencing technologies have proven that TEs can be transcribed in a regulated fashion, and their dysregulation might have a role in brain diseases.
METHODS: We exploited published datasets comprising RNA-seq data from (1) postmortem brain of ASD subjects, (2) in vitro cell cultures where ten different ASD-relevant genes were knocked out and (3) blood of discordant siblings. We measured the expression levels of evolutionarily young full-length transposable L1 elements and characterized the genomic location of deregulated L1s assessing their potential impact on the transcription of ASD-relevant genes. We analyzed every sample independently, avoiding to pool together the disease subjects to unmask the heterogeneity of the molecular phenotypes.
RESULTS: We detected a strong upregulation of intronic full-length L1s in a subset of postmortem brain samples and in in vitro differentiated neurons from iPSC knocked out for ATRX. L1 upregulation correlated with an high number of deregulated genes and retained introns. In the anterior cingulate cortex of one subject, a small number of significantly upregulated L1s overlapped with ASD-relevant genes that were significantly downregulated, suggesting the possible existence of a negative effect of L1 transcription on host transcripts.
LIMITATIONS: Our analyses must be considered exploratory and will need to be validated in bigger cohorts. The main limitation is given by the small sample size and by the lack of replicates for postmortem brain samples. Measuring the transcription of locus-specific TEs is complicated by the repetitive nature of their sequence, which reduces the accuracy in mapping sequencing reads to the correct genomic locus.
CONCLUSIONS: L1 upregulation in ASD appears to be limited to a subset of subjects that are also characterized by a general deregulation of the expression of canonical genes and an increase in intron retention. In some samples from the anterior cingulate cortex, L1s upregulation seems to directly impair the expression of some ASD-relevant genes by a still unknown mechanism. L1s upregulation may therefore identify a group of ASD subjects with common molecular features and helps stratifying individuals for novel strategies of therapeutic intervention."

38781372,Molecular cascades and cell type-specific signatures in ASD revealed by single-cell genomics.,2024,Science,10.1126/science.adh2602,"Genomic profiling in postmortem brain from autistic individuals has consistently revealed convergent molecular changes. What drives these changes and how they relate to genetic susceptibility in this complex condition are not well understood. We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain."
