Overall plan for the code:

1. finding relevant articles

    - Completed in processing.py


2. retrieving pdf of article, or article summary

    - Completed in processing.py, returns all retrievable articles in pdf format with the doi as its name
        nougat? See https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13418
    - 


3. retrieving raw data from articles

   - Completed in processing.py, returns supp. info files in directory for each article

   
4. checking each data file has the correct metadata to link back

    - OpenAI metadata tagger?
   

5. vectorising, embedding and storing the data

    - 

6. creating RAG to analyse the stored data



7. visualisation of the stored data



8. analysis on the stored data
