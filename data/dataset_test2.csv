Number of cells recoverd from each 10X scRNAseq library.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each library was prepared from an independent pool of organoids (3-7 organoids per pool). 14 librareis were prepared from 3 independent batches of organoids. Batch 1 (137116-137123); Batch 2 (213661-213663); Batch 3 (206283-206286).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
