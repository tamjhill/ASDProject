20868653,Gene and miRNA expression profiles in autism spectrum disorders.,2011,Brain Res,10.1016/j.brainres.2010.09.046,"Accumulating data indicate that there is significant genetic heterogeneity underlying the etiology in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some rare and highly-penetrant gene variants and copy number variation (CNV) regions including NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, SHANK2, SHANK3, PTCHD1, 1q21.1, maternally-inherited duplication of 15q11-q13, 16p11.2, amongst others, have been identified to be involved in ASD. Genome-wide association studies have identified other apparently low risk loci and in some other cases, ASD arises as a co-morbid phenotype with other medical genetic conditions (e.g. fragile X). The progress studying the genetics of ASD has largely been accomplished using genomic analyses of germline-derived DNA. Here, we used gene and miRNA expression profiling using cell-line derived total RNA to evaluate possible transcripts and networks of molecules involved in ASD. Our analysis identified several novel dysregulated genes and miRNAs in ASD compared with controls, including HEY1, SOX9, miR-486 and miR-181b. All of these are involved in nervous system development and function and some others, for example, are involved in NOTCH signaling networks (e.g. HEY1). Further, we found significant enrichment in molecules associated with neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome and those associated with nervous system development and function including long-term potentiation. Our data will provide a valuable resource for discovery purposes and for comparison to other gene expression-based, genome-wide DNA studies and other functional data."
21784246,FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.,2011,Cell,10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.013,"FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention."
26186191,FOXG1-Dependent Dysregulation of GABA/Glutamate Neuron Differentiation in Autism Spectrum Disorders.,2015,Cell,10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.034,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of brain development. Most cases lack a clear etiology or genetic basis, and the difficulty of re-enacting human brain development has precluded understanding of ASD pathophysiology. Here we use three-dimensional neural cultures (organoids) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate neurodevelopmental alterations in individuals with severe idiopathic ASD. While no known underlying genomic mutation could be identified, transcriptome and gene network analyses revealed upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic assembly. ASD-derived organoids exhibit an accelerated cell cycle and overproduction of GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Using RNA interference, we show that overexpression of the transcription factor FOXG1 is responsible for the overproduction of GABAergic neurons. Altered expression of gene network modules and FOXG1 are positively correlated with symptom severity. Our data suggest that a shift toward GABAergic neuron fate caused by FOXG1 is a developmental precursor of ASD."
30545856,"Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.",2018,Science,10.1126/science.aat8127,"Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development."
30547845,Co-expression of long non-coding RNAs and autism risk genes in the developing human brain.,2018,BMC Syst Biol,10.1186/s12918-018-0639-x,"BACKGROUND: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the umbrella term for a group of neurodevelopmental disorders convergent on behavioral phenotypes. While many genes have been implicated in the disorder, the predominant focus of previous research has been on protein coding genes. This leaves a vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) not characterized for their role in the disorder although lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in development and are highly represented in the brain. Studies have also shown lncRNAs to be differentially expressed in ASD affected brains. However, there has yet to be an enrichment analysis of the shared ontologies and pathways of known ASD genes and lncRNAs in normal brain development.
RESULTS: In this study, we performed co-expression network analysis on the developing brain transcriptome to identify potential lncRNAs associated with ASD and possible annotations for functional role of lncRNAs in brain development. We found co-enrichment of lncRNA genes and ASD risk genes in two distinct groups of modules showing elevated prenatal and postnatal expression patterns, respectively. Further enrichment analysis of the module groups indicated that the early expression modules were comprised mainly of transcriptional regulators while the later expression modules were associated with synapse formation. Finally, lncRNAs were prioritized for their connectivity with the known ASD risk genes through analysis of an adjacency matrix. Collectively, the results imply early developmental repression of synaptic genes through lncRNAs and ASD transcriptional regulators.
CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the utility of mining the publically available brain gene expression data to further functionally annotate the role of lncRNAs in ASD. Our analysis indicates that lncRNAs potentially have a key role in ASD due to their convergence on shared pathways, and we identify lncRNAs of interest that may lead to further avenues of study."
30827496,Missense Variants in the Histone Acetyltransferase Complex Component Gene TRRAP Cause Autism and Syndromic Intellectual Disability.,2019,Am J Hum Genet,10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.01.010,"Acetylation of the lysine residues in histones and other DNA-binding proteins plays a major role in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. This process is controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs/KATs) found in multiprotein complexes that are recruited to chromatin by the scaffolding subunit transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP). TRRAP is evolutionarily conserved and is among the top five genes intolerant to missense variation. Through an international collaboration, 17 distinct de novo or apparently de novo variants were identified in TRRAP in 24 individuals. A strong genotype-phenotype correlation was observed with two distinct clinical spectra. The first is a complex, multi-systemic syndrome associated with various malformations of the brain, heart, kidneys, and genitourinary system and characterized by a wide range of intellectual functioning; a number of affected individuals have intellectual disability (ID) and markedly impaired basic life functions. Individuals with this phenotype had missense variants clustering around the c.3127G>A p.(Ala1043Thr) variant identified in five individuals. The second spectrum manifested with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or ID and epilepsy. Facial dysmorphism was seen in both groups and included upslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthus, telecanthus, a wide nasal bridge and ridge, a broad and smooth philtrum, and a thin upper lip. RNA sequencing analysis of skin fibroblasts derived from affected individuals skin fibroblasts showed significant changes in the expression of several genes implicated in neuronal function and ion transport. Thus, we describe here the clinical spectrum associated with TRRAP pathogenic missense variants, and we suggest a genotype-phenotype correlation useful for clinical evaluation of the pathogenicity of the variants."
32327736,Impaired expression of the COSMOC/MOCOS gene unit in ASD patient stem cells.,2021,Mol Psychiatry,10.1038/s41380-020-0728-2,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders with a very large number of risk loci detected in the genome. However, at best, each of them explains rare cases, the majority being idiopathic. Genomic data on ASD derive mostly from post-mortem brain analyses or cell lines derived from blood or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCS). Therefore, the transcriptional and regulatory architecture of the nervous system, particularly during early developmental periods, remains highly incomplete. To access the critical disturbances that may have occurred during pregnancy or early childhood, we recently isolated stem cells from the nasal cavity of anesthetized patients diagnosed for ASD and compared them to stem cells from gender-matched control individuals without neuropsychiatric disorders. This allowed us to discover MOCOS, a non-mutated molybdenum cofactor sulfurase-coding gene that was under-expressed in the stem cells of most ASD patients of our cohort, disturbing redox homeostasis and synaptogenesis. We now report that a divergent transcription upstream of MOCOS generates an antisense long noncoding RNA, to which we coined the name COSMOC. Surprisingly, COSMOC is strongly under-expressed in all ASD patients of our cohort with the exception of a patient affected by Asperger syndrome. Knockdown studies indicate that loss of COSMOC reduces MOCOS expression, destabilizes lipid and energy metabolisms of stem cells, but also affects neuronal maturation and splicing of synaptic genes. Impaired expression of the COSMOC/MOCOS bidirectional unit might shed new lights on the origins of ASD that could be of importance for future translational studies."
32926339,Sex-and Region-Dependent Expression of the Autism-Linked ADNP Correlates with Social- and Speech-Related Genes in the Canary Brain.,2020,J Mol Neurosci,10.1007/s12031-020-01700-x,"The activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) syndrome is an autistic-like disorder, instigated by mutations in ADNP. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, impairments in speech, motor function, abnormal hearing, and intellectual disabilities. In the Adnp-haploinsufficient mouse model, many of these impediments are evident, appearing in a sex-dependent manner. In zebra finch songbird (ZF; Taeniopygia guttata), an animal model used for song/language studies, ADNP mRNA most robust expression is observed in the cerebrum of young males, potentially corroborating with male ZF exclusive singing behavior and developed cerebral song system. Herein, we report a similar sex-dependent ADNP expression profile, with the highest expression in the cerebrum (qRT-PCR) in the brain of another songbird, the domesticated canary (Serinus canaria domestica). Additional analyses for the mRNA transcripts of the ADNP regulator, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), sister gene ADNP2, and speech-related Forkhead box protein P2 (FoxP2) revealed multiple sex and brain region-dependent positive correlations between the genes (including ADNP). Parallel transcript expression patterns for FoxP2 and VIP were observed alongside specific FoxP2 increase in males compared with females as well as VIP/ADNP2 correlations. In spatial view, a sexually independent extensive form of expression was found for ADNP in the canary cerebrum (RNA in situ hybridization). The songbird cerebral mesopallium area stood out as a potentially high-expressing ADNP tissue, further strengthening the association of ADNP with sense integration and auditory memory formation, previously implicated in mouse and human."
33116122,Relationships between UBE3A and SNORD116 expression and features of autism in chromosome 15 imprinting disorders.,2020,Transl Psychiatry,10.1038/s41398-020-01034-7,"Chromosome 15 (C15) imprinting disorders including Prader-Willi (PWS), Angelman (AS) and chromosome 15 duplication (Dup15q) syndromes are severe neurodevelopmental disorders caused by abnormal expression of genes from the 15q11-q13 region, associated with abnormal DNA methylation and/or copy number changes. This study compared changes in mRNA levels of UBE3A and SNORD116 located within the 15q11-q13 region between these disorders and their subtypes and related these to the clinical phenotypes. The study cohort included 58 participants affected with a C15 imprinting disorder (PWS = 27, AS = 21, Dup15q = 10) and 20 typically developing controls. Semi-quantitative analysis of mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed using reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for UBE3A and SNORD116 normalised to a panel of internal control genes determined using the geNorm approach. Participants completed an intellectual/developmental functioning assessment and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition. The Dup15q group was the only condition with significantly increased UBE3A mRNA levels when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Both the AS and Dup15q groups also had significantly elevated SNORD116 mRNA levels compared to controls (AS: p < 0.0001; Dup15q: p = 0.002). Both UBE3A and SNORD116 mRNA levels were positively correlated with all developmental functioning scores in the deletion AS group (p < 0.001), and autism features (p < 0.001) in the non-deletion PWS group. The findings suggest presence of novel interactions between expression of UBE3A and SNORD116 in PBMCs and brain specific processes underlying motor and language impairments and autism features in these disorders."
33157009,NCKAP1 Disruptive Variants Lead to a Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Core Features of Autism.,2020,Am J Hum Genet,10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.10.002,"NCKAP1/NAP1 regulates neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics and is essential for neuronal differentiation in the developing brain. Deleterious variants in NCKAP1 have been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability; however, its clinical significance remains unclear. To determine its significance, we assemble genotype and phenotype data for 21 affected individuals from 20 unrelated families with predicted deleterious variants in NCKAP1. This includes 16 individuals with de novo (n = 8), transmitted (n = 6), or inheritance unknown (n = 2) truncating variants, two individuals with structural variants, and three with potentially disruptive de novo missense variants. We report a de novo and ultra-rare deleterious variant burden of NCKAP1 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders which needs further replication. ASD or autistic features, language and motor delay, and variable expression of intellectual or learning disability are common clinical features. Among inherited cases, there is evidence of deleterious variants segregating with neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on available human brain transcriptomic data, we show that NCKAP1 is broadly and highly expressed in both prenatal and postnatal periods and demostrate enriched expression in excitatory neurons and radial glias but depleted expression in inhibitory neurons. Mouse in utero electroporation experiments reveal that Nckap1 loss of function promotes neuronal migration during early cortical development. Combined, these data support a role for disruptive NCKAP1 variants in neurodevelopmental delay/autism, possibly by interfering with neuronal migration early in cortical development."
33160303,Prediction and prioritization of autism-associated long non-coding RNAs using gene expression and sequence features.,2020,BMC Bioinformatics,10.1186/s12859-020-03843-5,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) refer to a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, which are genetically complex and heterogeneous with most of the genetic risk factors also found in the unaffected general population. Although all the currently known ASD risk genes code for proteins, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as essential regulators of gene expression have been implicated in ASD. Some lncRNAs show altered expression levels in autistic brains, but their roles in ASD pathogenesis are still unclear.
RESULTS: In this study, we have developed a new machine learning approach to predict candidate lncRNAs associated with ASD. Particularly, the knowledge learnt from protein-coding ASD risk genes was transferred to the prediction and prioritization of ASD-associated lncRNAs. Both developmental brain gene expression data and transcript sequence were found to contain relevant information for ASD risk gene prediction. During the pre-training phase of model construction, an autoencoder network was implemented for a representation learning of the gene expression data, and a random-forest-based feature selection was applied to the transcript-sequence-derived k-mers. Our models, including logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest, showed robust performance based on tenfold cross-validations as well as candidate prioritization with hypothetical loci. We then utilized the models to predict and prioritize a list of candidate lncRNAs, including some reported to be cis-regulators of known ASD risk genes, for further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ASD risk genes can be accurately predicted using developmental brain gene expression data and transcript sequence features, and the models may provide useful information for functional characterization of the candidate lncRNAs associated with ASD."
33243861,In vivo Perturb-Seq reveals neuronal and glial abnormalities associated with autism risk genes.,2020,Science,10.1126/science.aaz6063,"The number of disease risk genes and loci identified through human genetic studies far outstrips the capacity to systematically study their functions. We applied a scalable genetic screening approach, in vivo Perturb-Seq, to functionally evaluate 35 autism spectrum disorder/neurodevelopmental delay (ASD/ND) de novo loss-of-function risk genes. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced frameshift mutations in these risk genes in pools, within the developing mouse brain in utero, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing of perturbed cells in the postnatal brain. We identified cell type-specific and evolutionarily conserved gene modules from both neuronal and glial cell classes. Recurrent gene modules and cell types are affected across this cohort of perturbations, representing key cellular effects across sets of ASD/ND risk genes. In vivo Perturb-Seq allows us to investigate how diverse mutations affect cell types and states in the developing organism."
34115273,MEG3 lncRNA is over-expressed in autism spectrum disorder.,2021,Metab Brain Dis,10.1007/s11011-021-00764-x,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a group of regulatory transcripts which partake in the biological processes leading to development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We measured circulatory levels of MEG3, GAS5, CYTOR, UCA1 lncRNAs and CRYBG3 gene in children with ASD and controls. Expression of MEG3 was remarkably higher in children with ASD when compared with controls (Posterior Beta = 2.919, SE = 0.51, P value < 0.0001). This difference was significant among male subgroups (Posterior Beta = 2.913, SE = 0.56, P value < 0.0001) as well as female subgroups (95% CrI for Beta = [0.29, 2.4], SE = 0.53, P value < 0.0001). Expression levels of other lncRNAs or CRYBG3 were not different between children with ASD and controls. Among children with ASD, the most robust correlations were found between GAS5/CYTOR, CYTOR/UCA1 and GAS5/UCA1 with correlation coefficients of 0.83, 0.83 and 0.73, respectively. Among controls, GAS5/UCA1, MEG3/UCA1 and GAS5/MEG3 pairs had the highest correlation coefficients (0.89, 0.84 and 0.80, respectively). ROC curve analysis revealed that MEG3 can distinguish children with ASD from controls with diagnostic power of 0.792 (P value < 0.0001). This value was higher among male subgroups (AUC = 0.84, P value < 0.0001) compared with female subgroups (AUC = 0.727, P value = 0.0727). The current research highlights the role of MEG3 in ASD and provides clues for depiction of an lncRNA network with possible contribution in the pathogenesis of ASD."
34535545,A survey of RNA editing at single-cell resolution links interneurons to schizophrenia and autism.,2021,RNA,10.1261/rna.078804.121,"Conversion of adenosine to inosine in RNA by ADAR enzymes, termed ""RNA editing,"" is essential for healthy brain development. Editing is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric diseases, but has not yet been investigated at scale at the level of individual neurons. We quantified RNA editing sites in nuclear transcriptomes of 3055 neurons from six cortical regions of a neurotypical female donor, and found 41,930 sites present in at least ten nuclei. Most sites were located within Alu repeats in introns or 3' UTRs, and approximately 80% were cataloged in public RNA editing databases. We identified 9285 putative novel editing sites, 29% of which were also detectable in unrelated donors. Intersection with results from bulk RNA-seq studies provided cell-type and spatial context for 1730 sites that are differentially edited in schizophrenic brain donors, and 910 such sites in autistic donors. Autism-related genes were also enriched with editing sites predicted to modify RNA structure. Inhibitory neurons showed higher overall transcriptome editing than excitatory neurons, and the highest editing rates were observed in the frontal cortex. We used generalized linear models to identify differentially edited sites and genes between cell types. Twenty nine genes were preferentially edited in excitatory neurons, and 43 genes were edited more heavily in inhibitory neurons, including "
35710789,SFARI genes and where to find them; modelling Autism Spectrum Disorder specific gene expression dysregulation with RNA-seq data.,2022,Sci Rep,10.1038/s41598-022-14077-1,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have a strong, yet heterogeneous, genetic component. Among the various methods that are being developed to help reveal the underlying molecular aetiology of the disease one approach that is gaining popularity is the combination of gene expression and clinical genetic data, often using the SFARI-gene database, which comprises lists of curated genes considered to have causative roles in ASD when mutated in patients. We build a gene co-expression network to study the relationship between ASD-specific transcriptomic data and SFARI genes and then analyse it at different levels of granularity. No significant evidence is found of association between SFARI genes and differential gene expression patterns when comparing ASD samples to a control group, nor statistical enrichment of SFARI genes in gene co-expression network modules that have a strong correlation with ASD diagnosis. However, classification models that incorporate topological information from the whole ASD-specific gene co-expression network can predict novel SFARI candidate genes that share features of existing SFARI genes and have support for roles in ASD in the literature. A statistically significant association is also found between the absolute level of gene expression and SFARI's genes and Scores, which can confound the analysis if uncorrected. We propose a novel approach to correct for this that is general enough to be applied to other problems affected by continuous sources of bias. It was found that only co-expression network analyses that integrate information from the whole network are able to reveal signatures linked to ASD diagnosis and novel candidate genes for the study of ASD, which individual gene or module analyses fail to do. It was also found that the influence of SFARI genes permeates not only other ASD scoring systems, but also lists of genes believed to be involved in other neurodevelopmental disorders."
35962193,Trans-genetic effects of circular RNA expression quantitative trait loci and potential causal mechanisms in autism.,2022,Mol Psychiatry,10.1038/s41380-022-01714-4,"Genetic risk variants and transcriptional expression changes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were widely investigated, but their causal relationship remains largely unknown. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in brain and often serve as upstream regulators of mRNAs. By integrating RNA-sequencing with genotype data from autistic brains, we assessed expression quantitative trait loci of circRNAs (circQTLs) that cis-regulated expression of nearby circRNAs and trans-regulated expression of distant genes (trans-eGenes) simultaneously. We thus identified 3619 circQTLs that were also trans-eQTLs and constructed 19,804 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory axes. We conducted two different types of approaches, mediation and partial correlation tests (MPT), to determine the axes with mediation effects of circQTLs on trans-eGene expression through circRNA expression. We showed that the mediation effects of the circQTLs (trans-eQTLs) on circRNA expression were positively correlated with the magnitude of circRNA-trans-eGene correlation of expression profile. The positive correlation became more significant after adjustment for the circQTLs. Of the 19,804 axes, 8103 passed MPT. Meanwhile, we performed causal inference test (CIT) and identified 2070 circQTL-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths. We showed that the CIT-passing genes were significantly enriched for ASD risk genes, genes encoding postsynaptic density proteins, and other ASD-relevant genes, supporting the relevance of the CIT-passing genes to ASD pathophysiology. Integration of MPT- and CIT-passing axes further constructed 352 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths, wherein the circRNA-trans-eGene axes may act as causal mediators for the circQTL-ASD diagnosis associations. These analyses were also successfully applied to an independent dataset from schizophrenia brains. Collectively, this study provided the first framework for systematically investigating trans-genetic effects of circQTLs and inferring the corresponding causal relations in diseases. The identified circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory interactions, particularly the internal modules that were previously implicated in the examined disorders, also provided a helpful dataset for further investigating causative biology and cryptic regulatory mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric diseases."
36213201,Cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of neocortical circuit organization and their relevance to autism.,2022,Front Neural Circuits,10.3389/fncir.2022.982721,"A prevailing challenge in neuroscience is understanding how diverse neuronal cell types select their synaptic partners to form circuits. In the neocortex, major classes of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons are conserved across functionally distinct regions. There is evidence these classes form canonical circuit motifs that depend primarily on their identity; however, regional cues likely also influence their choice of synaptic partners. We mined the Allen Institute's single-cell RNA-sequencing database of mouse cortical neurons to study the expression of genes necessary for synaptic connectivity and physiology in two regions: the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the primary visual cortex (VISp). We used the Allen's metadata to parse cells by clusters representing major excitatory and inhibitory classes that are common to both ALM and VISp. We then performed two types of pairwise differential gene expression analysis: (1) between different neuronal classes within the same brain region (ALM or VISp), and (2) between the same neuronal class in ALM and VISp. We filtered our results for differentially expressed genes related to circuit connectivity and developed a novel bioinformatic approach to determine the sets uniquely enriched in each neuronal class in ALM, VISp, or both. This analysis provides an organized set of genes that may regulate synaptic connectivity and physiology in a cell-type-specific manner. Furthermore, it identifies candidate mechanisms for circuit organization that are conserved across functionally distinct cortical regions or that are region dependent. Finally, we used the SFARI Human Gene Module to identify genes from this analysis that are related to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our analysis provides clear molecular targets for future studies to understand neocortical circuit organization and abnormalities that underlie autistic phenotypes."

36743290,Characterizing microRNA editing and mutation sites in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,2022,Front Mol Neurosci,10.3389/fnmol.2022.1105278,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose pathogenesis is still unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a kind of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes. Recent researches show that miRNAs are edited in multiple ways especially in central nervous systems. A-to-I editing of RNA catalyzed by Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) happens intensively in brain and is also noticed in other organs and tissues. Although miRNAs are widely edited in human brain, miRNA editing in ASD is still largely unexplored. In order to reveal the editing events of miRNAs in ASD, we analyzed 131 miRNA-seq samples from 8 different brain regions of ASD patients and normal controls. We identified 834 editing sites with significant editing levels, of which 70 sites showed significantly different editing levels in the superior frontal gyrus samples of ASD patients (ASD-SFG) when compared with those of control samples. The editing level of an A-to-I editing site in hsa-mir-376a-1 (hsa-mir-376a-1_9_A_g) in ASD-SFG is higher than that of normal controls, and the difference is exaggerated in individuals under 10 years.

37319303,A systematic review of non-coding RNA genes with differential expression profiles associated with autism spectrum disorders.,2023,PLoS One,10.1371/journal.pone.0287131,"AIMS: To identify differential expression of shorter non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
BACKGROUND: ncRNA are functional molecules that derive from non-translated DNA sequence. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) have approved ncRNA gene classes with alignment to the reference human genome. One subset is microRNA (miRNA), which are highly conserved, short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by direct post-transcriptional repression of messenger RNA. Several miRNA genes are implicated in the development and regulation of the nervous system. Expression of miRNA genes in ASD cohorts have been examined by multiple research groups. Other shorter classes of ncRNA have been examined less. A comprehensive systematic review examining expression of shorter ncRNA gene classes in ASD is timely to inform the direction of research.
METHODS: We extracted data from studies examining ncRNA gene expression in ASD compared with non-ASD controls. We included studies on miRNA, piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), small NF90 (ILF3) associated RNA (snaR), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), vault RNA (vtRNA) and Y RNA. The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ERIC, AMED and CINAHL for papers published from January 2000 to May 2022. Studies were screened by two independent investigators with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from eligible papers.
RESULTS: Forty-eight eligible studies were included in our systematic review with the majority examining miRNA gene expression alone. Sixty-four miRNA genes had differential expression in ASD compared to controls as reported in two or more studies, but often in opposing directions. Four miRNA genes had differential expression in the same direction in the same tissue type in at least 3 separate studies. Increased expression was reported in miR-106b-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p in blood, post-mortem brain, and across several tissue types, respectively. Decreased expression was reported in miR-328-3p in bloods samples. Seven studies examined differential expression from other classes of ncRNA, including piRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and Y RNA. No individual ncRNA genes were reported in more than one study. Six studies reported differentially expressed snoRNA genes in ASD. A meta-analysis was not possible because of inconsistent methodologies, disparate tissue types examined, and varying forms of data presented.
CONCLUSION: There is limited but promising evidence associating the expression of certain miRNA genes and ASD, although the studies are of variable methodological quality and the results are largely inconsistent. There is emerging evidence associating differential expression of snoRNA genes in ASD. It is not currently possible to say whether the reports of differential expression in ncRNA may relate to ASD aetiology, a response to shared environmental factors linked to ASD such as sleep and nutrition, other molecular functions, human diversity, or chance findings. To improve our understanding of any potential association, we recommend improved and standardised methodologies and reporting of raw data. Further high-quality research is required to shine a light on possible associations, which may yet yield important information."
37381037,Exploratory analysis of L1 retrotransposons expression in autism﻿.,2023,Mol Autism,10.1186/s13229-023-00554-5,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental diseases whose genetic etiology is not completely understood. Several investigations have relied on transcriptome analysis from peripheral tissues to dissect ASD into homogenous molecular phenotypes. Recently, analysis of changes in gene expression from postmortem brain tissues has identified sets of genes that are involved in pathways previously associated with ASD etiology. In addition to protein-coding transcripts, the human transcriptome is composed by a large set of non-coding RNAs and transposable elements (TEs). Advancements in sequencing technologies have proven that TEs can be transcribed in a regulated fashion, and their dysregulation might have a role in brain diseases.
METHODS: We exploited published datasets comprising RNA-seq data from (1) postmortem brain of ASD subjects, (2) in vitro cell cultures where ten different ASD-relevant genes were knocked out and (3) blood of discordant siblings. We measured the expression levels of evolutionarily young full-length transposable L1 elements and characterized the genomic location of deregulated L1s assessing their potential impact on the transcription of ASD-relevant genes. We analyzed every sample independently, avoiding to pool together the disease subjects to unmask the heterogeneity of the molecular phenotypes.
RESULTS: We detected a strong upregulation of intronic full-length L1s in a subset of postmortem brain samples and in in vitro differentiated neurons from iPSC knocked out for ATRX. L1 upregulation correlated with an high number of deregulated genes and retained introns. In the anterior cingulate cortex of one subject, a small number of significantly upregulated L1s overlapped with ASD-relevant genes that were significantly downregulated, suggesting the possible existence of a negative effect of L1 transcription on host transcripts.
LIMITATIONS: Our analyses must be considered exploratory and will need to be validated in bigger cohorts. The main limitation is given by the small sample size and by the lack of replicates for postmortem brain samples. Measuring the transcription of locus-specific TEs is complicated by the repetitive nature of their sequence, which reduces the accuracy in mapping sequencing reads to the correct genomic locus.
CONCLUSIONS: L1 upregulation in ASD appears to be limited to a subset of subjects that are also characterized by a general deregulation of the expression of canonical genes and an increase in intron retention. In some samples from the anterior cingulate cortex, L1s upregulation seems to directly impair the expression of some ASD-relevant genes by a still unknown mechanism. L1s upregulation may therefore identify a group of ASD subjects with common molecular features and helps stratifying individuals for novel strategies of therapeutic intervention."
37486945,The ortholog of human ssDNA-binding protein SSBP3 influences neurodevelopment and autism-like behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster.,2023,PLoS Biol,10.1371/journal.pbio.3002210,"1p32.3 microdeletion/duplication is implicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders-like phenotypes such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, macro/microcephaly, and dysmorphic features. The 1p32.3 chromosomal region harbors several genes critical for development; however, their validation and characterization remain inadequate. One such gene is the single-stranded DNA-binding protein 3 (SSBP3) and its Drosophila melanogaster ortholog is called sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein (Ssdp). Here, we investigated consequences of Ssdp manipulations on neurodevelopment, gene expression, physiological function, and autism-associated behaviors using Drosophila models. We found that SSBP3 and Ssdp are expressed in excitatory neurons in the brain. Ssdp overexpression caused morphological alterations in Drosophila wing, mechanosensory bristles, and head. Ssdp manipulations also affected the neuropil brain volume and glial cell number in larvae and adult flies. Moreover, Ssdp overexpression led to differential changes in synaptic density in specific brain regions. We observed decreased levels of armadillo in the heads of Ssdp overexpressing flies, as well as a decrease in armadillo and wingless expression in the larval wing discs, implicating the involvement of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in Ssdp functionality. RNA sequencing revealed perturbation of oxidative stress-related pathways in heads of Ssdp overexpressing flies. Furthermore, Ssdp overexpressing brains showed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered neuronal mitochondrial morphology, and up-regulated fission and fusion genes. Flies with elevated levels of Ssdp exhibited heightened anxiety-like behavior, altered decisiveness, defective sensory perception and habituation, abnormal social interaction, and feeding defects, which were phenocopied in the pan-neuronal Ssdp knockdown flies, suggesting that Ssdp is dosage sensitive. Partial rescue of behavioral defects was observed upon normalization of Ssdp levels. Notably, Ssdp knockdown exclusively in adult flies did not produce behavioral and functional defects. Finally, we show that optogenetic manipulation of Ssdp-expressing neurons altered autism-associated behaviors. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that Ssdp, a dosage-sensitive gene in the 1p32.3 chromosomal region, is associated with various anatomical, physiological, and behavioral defects, which may be relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism. Our study proposes SSBP3 as a critical gene in the 1p32.3 microdeletion/duplication genomic region and sheds light on the functional role of Ssdp in neurodevelopmental processes in Drosophila."
37693465,Relationship between sex biases in gene expression and sex biases in autism and Alzheimer's disease.,2023,medRxiv,10.1101/2023.08.29.23294773,"Sex differences in the brain may play an important role in sex-differential prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions. In order to understand the transcriptional basis of sex differences, we analyzed multiple, large-scale, human postmortem brain RNA-seq datasets using both within-region and pan-regional frameworks. We find evidence of sex-biased transcription in many autosomal genes, some of which provide evidence for pathways and cell population differences between chromosomally male and female individuals. These analyses also highlight regional differences in the extent of sex-differential gene expression. We observe an increase in specific neuronal transcripts in male brains and an increase in immune and glial function-related transcripts in female brains. Integration with single-cell data suggests this corresponds to sex differences in cellular states rather than cell abundance. Integration with case-control gene expression studies suggests a female molecular predisposition towards Alzheimer's disease, a female-biased disease. Autism, a male-biased diagnosis, does not exhibit a male predisposition pattern in our analysis. Finally, we provide region specific analyses of sex differences in brain gene expression to enable additional studies at the interface of gene expression and diagnostic differences."

37759036,"Tumor suppressor p53 modulates activity-dependent synapse strengthening, autism-like behavior and hippocampus-dependent learning.",2023,Mol Psychiatry,10.1038/s41380-023-02268-9,"Synaptic potentiation underlies various forms of behavior and depends on modulation by multiple activity-dependent transcription factors to coordinate the expression of genes necessary for sustaining synaptic transmission. Our current study identified the tumor suppressor p53 as a novel transcription factor involved in this process. We first revealed that p53 could be elevated upon chemically induced long-term potentiation (cLTP) in cultured primary neurons. By knocking down p53 in neurons, we further showed that p53 is required for cLTP-induced elevation of surface GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Because LTP is one of the principal plasticity mechanisms underlying behaviors, we employed forebrain-specific knockdown of p53 to evaluate the role of p53 in behavior. Our results showed that, while knocking down p53 in mice does not alter locomotion or anxiety-like behavior, it significantly promotes repetitive behavior and reduces sociability in mice of both sexes. In addition, knocking down p53 also impairs hippocampal LTP and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Most importantly, these learning-associated defects are more pronounced in male mice than in female mice, suggesting a sex-specific role of p53 in these behaviors. Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify p53-associated genes in the hippocampus, we showed that knocking down p53 up- or down-regulates multiple genes with known functions in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Altogether, our study suggests p53 as an activity-dependent transcription factor that mediates the surface expression of AMPAR, permits hippocampal synaptic plasticity, represses autism-like behavior, and promotes hippocampus-dependent learning and memory."
38057311,Integrative analysis of long noncoding RNAs dysregulation and synapse-associated ceRNA regulatory axes in autism.,2023,Transl Psychiatry,10.1038/s41398-023-02662-5,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder of neurodevelopment, the function of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in ASD remains essentially unknown. In the present study, gene networks were used to explore the ASD disease mechanisms integrating multiple data types (for example, RNA expression, whole-exome sequencing signals, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and protein-protein interaction) and datasets (five human postmortem datasets). A total of 388 lncRNAs and five co-expression modules were found to be altered in ASD. The downregulated co-expression M4 module was significantly correlated with ASD, enriched with autism susceptibility genes and synaptic signaling. Integrating lncRNAs from the M4 module and microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation data from the literature identified competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. We identified the downregulated mRNAs that interact with miRNAs by the miRTarBase, miRDB, and TargetScan databases. Our analysis reveals that MIR600HG was downregulated in multiple brain tissue datasets and was closely associated with 9 autism-susceptible miRNAs in the ceRNA network. MIR600HG and target mRNAs (EPHA4, MOAP1, MAP3K9, STXBP1, PRKCE, and SCAMP5) were downregulated in the peripheral blood by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis (false discovery rate <0.05). Subsequently, we assessed the role of lncRNA dysregulation in altered mRNA levels. Experimental verification showed that some synapse-associated mRNAs were downregulated after the MIR600HG knockdown. BrainSpan project showed that the expression patterns of MIR600HG (primate-specific lncRNA) and synapse-associated mRNA were similar in different human brain regions and at different stages of development. A combination of support vector machine and random forest machine learning algorithms retrieved the marker gene for ASD in the ceRNA network, and the area under the curve of the diagnostic nomogram was 0.851. In conclusion, dysregulation of MIR600HG, a novel specific lncRNA associated with ASD, is responsible for the ASD-associated miRNA-mRNA axes, thereby potentially regulating synaptogenesis."

What drives these changes and how they relate to genetic susceptibility in this complex condition are not well understood. We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain."

Duplication of 15q11.2-13.1 (dup15q) is a well-described neurodevelopmental syndrome that increases the risk of ASD by over 40-fold. However, the effects of this duplication on gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types in the human brain remain unknown. To identify the cell-type-specific transcriptional and epigenetic effects of dup15q in the human frontal cortex we conducted single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multi-omic sequencing on dup15q cases (n=6) as well as non-dup15q ASD (n=7) and neurotypical controls (n=7). Cell-type-specific differential expression analysis identified significantly regulated genes, critical biological pathways, and differentially accessible genomic regions. Although there was overall increased gene expression across the duplicated genomic region, cellular identity represented an important factor mediating gene expression changes. Neuronal subtypes, showed greater upregulation of gene expression across a critical region within the duplication as compared to other cell types. Genes within the duplicated region that had high baseline expression in control individuals showed only modest changes in dup15q, regardless of cell type. Of note, dup15q and ASD had largely distinct signatures of chromatin accessibility, but shared the majority of transcriptional regulatory motifs, suggesting convergent biological pathways. However, the transcriptional binding factor motifs implicated in each condition implicated distinct biological mechanisms; neuronal JUN/FOS networks in ASD vs. an inflammatory transcriptional network in dup15q microglia. This work provides a cell-type-specific analysis of how dup15q changes gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the human brain and finds evidence of marked cell-type-specific effects of this genetic driver. These findings have implications for guiding therapeutic development in dup15q syndrome, as well as understanding the functional effects CNVs more broadly in neurodevelopmental disorders."
