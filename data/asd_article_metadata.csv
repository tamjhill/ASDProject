33716665,Identification of Natural Antisense Transcripts in Mouse Brain and Their Association With Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Genes.,2021,Front Mol Neurosci,10.3389/fnmol.2021.624881,"Genome-wide sequencing technologies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interestingly, a number of ASD-related genes express natural antisense transcripts (NATs). In some cases, these NATs have been shown to play a regulatory role in sense strand gene expression and thus contribute to brain function. However, a detailed study examining the transcriptional relationship between ASD-related genes and their NAT partners is lacking. We performed strand-specific, deep RNA sequencing to profile expression of sense and antisense reads with a focus on 100 ASD-related genes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and striatum across mouse post-natal development (P7, P14, and P56). Using "

34946850,Gene Regulation Analysis Reveals Perturbations of Autism Spectrum Disorder during Neural System Development.,2021,Genes (Basel),10.3390/genes12121901,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impedes patients' cognition, social, speech and communication skills. ASD is highly heterogeneous with a variety of etiologies and clinical manifestations. The prevalence rate of ASD increased steadily in recent years. Presently, molecular mechanisms underlying ASD occurrence and development remain to be elucidated. Here, we integrated multi-layer genomics data to investigate the transcriptome and pathway dysregulations in ASD development. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression profiles of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neuron cells from ASD and normal samples were compared in our study. We found that substantially more genes were differentially expressed in the NPCs than the iPSCs. Consistently, gene set variation analysis revealed that the activity of the known ASD pathways in NPCs and neural cells were significantly different from the iPSCs, suggesting that ASD occurred at the early stage of neural system development. We further constructed comprehensive brain- and neural-specific regulatory networks by incorporating transcription factor (TF) and gene interactions with long 5 non-coding RNA(lncRNA) and protein interactions. We then overlaid the transcriptomes of different cell types on the regulatory networks to infer the regulatory cascades. The variations of the regulatory cascades between ASD and normal samples uncovered a set of novel disease-associated genes and gene interactions, particularly highlighting the functional roles of "
34947998,Autism-Related Transcription Factors Underlying the Sex-Specific Effects of Prenatal Bisphenol A Exposure on Transcriptome-Interactome Profiles in the Offspring Prefrontal Cortex.,2021,Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms222413201,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). BPA exposure dysregulates ASD-related genes in the hippocampus and neurological functions of offspring. However, whether prenatal BPA exposure has an impact on genes in the prefrontal cortex, another brain region highly implicated in ASD, and through what mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the transcriptome-interactome profiles of the prefrontal cortex of neonatal rats. Interestingly, the list of BPA-responsive genes was significantly enriched with known ASD candidate genes, as well as genes that were dysregulated in the postmortem brain tissues of ASD cases from multiple independent studies. Moreover, several differentially expressed genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex were the targets of ASD-related transcription factors, including AR, ESR1, and RORA. The hypergeometric distribution analysis revealed that BPA may regulate the expression of such genes through these transcription factors in a sex-dependent manner. The molecular docking analysis of BPA and ASD-related transcription factors revealed novel potential targets of BPA, including RORA, SOX5, TCF4, and YY1. Our findings indicated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts ASD-related genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex and may increase the risk of ASD through sex-dependent molecular mechanisms, which should be investigated further."

35710789,SFARI genes and where to find them; modelling Autism Spectrum Disorder specific gene expression dysregulation with RNA-seq data.,2022,Sci Rep,10.1038/s41598-022-14077-1,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have a strong, yet heterogeneous, genetic component. Among the various methods that are being developed to help reveal the underlying molecular aetiology of the disease one approach that is gaining popularity is the combination of gene expression and clinical genetic data, often using the SFARI-gene database, which comprises lists of curated genes considered to have causative roles in ASD when mutated in patients. We build a gene co-expression network to study the relationship between ASD-specific transcriptomic data and SFARI genes and then analyse it at different levels of granularity. No significant evidence is found of association between SFARI genes and differential gene expression patterns when comparing ASD samples to a control group, nor statistical enrichment of SFARI genes in gene co-expression network modules that have a strong correlation with ASD diagnosis. However, classification models that incorporate topological information from the whole ASD-specific gene co-expression network can predict novel SFARI candidate genes that share features of existing SFARI genes and have support for roles in ASD in the literature. A statistically significant association is also found between the absolute level of gene expression and SFARI's genes and Scores, which can confound the analysis if uncorrected. We propose a novel approach to correct for this that is general enough to be applied to other problems affected by continuous sources of bias. It was found that only co-expression network analyses that integrate information from the whole network are able to reveal signatures linked to ASD diagnosis and novel candidate genes for the study of ASD, which individual gene or module analyses fail to do. It was also found that the influence of SFARI genes permeates not only other ASD scoring systems, but also lists of genes believed to be involved in other neurodevelopmental disorders."
35962193,Trans-genetic effects of circular RNA expression quantitative trait loci and potential causal mechanisms in autism.,2022,Mol Psychiatry,10.1038/s41380-022-01714-4,"Genetic risk variants and transcriptional expression changes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were widely investigated, but their causal relationship remains largely unknown. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in brain and often serve as upstream regulators of mRNAs. By integrating RNA-sequencing with genotype data from autistic brains, we assessed expression quantitative trait loci of circRNAs (circQTLs) that cis-regulated expression of nearby circRNAs and trans-regulated expression of distant genes (trans-eGenes) simultaneously. We thus identified 3619 circQTLs that were also trans-eQTLs and constructed 19,804 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory axes. We conducted two different types of approaches, mediation and partial correlation tests (MPT), to determine the axes with mediation effects of circQTLs on trans-eGene expression through circRNA expression. We showed that the mediation effects of the circQTLs (trans-eQTLs) on circRNA expression were positively correlated with the magnitude of circRNA-trans-eGene correlation of expression profile. The positive correlation became more significant after adjustment for the circQTLs. Of the 19,804 axes, 8103 passed MPT. Meanwhile, we performed causal inference test (CIT) and identified 2070 circQTL-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths. We showed that the CIT-passing genes were significantly enriched for ASD risk genes, genes encoding postsynaptic density proteins, and other ASD-relevant genes, supporting the relevance of the CIT-passing genes to ASD pathophysiology. Integration of MPT- and CIT-passing axes further constructed 352 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths, wherein the circRNA-trans-eGene axes may act as causal mediators for the circQTL-ASD diagnosis associations. These analyses were also successfully applied to an independent dataset from schizophrenia brains. Collectively, this study provided the first framework for systematically investigating trans-genetic effects of circQTLs and inferring the corresponding causal relations in diseases. The identified circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory interactions, particularly the internal modules that were previously implicated in the examined disorders, also provided a helpful dataset for further investigating causative biology and cryptic regulatory mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric diseases."
36213201,Cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of neocortical circuit organization and their relevance to autism.,2022,Front Neural Circuits,10.3389/fncir.2022.982721,"A prevailing challenge in neuroscience is understanding how diverse neuronal cell types select their synaptic partners to form circuits. In the neocortex, major classes of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons are conserved across functionally distinct regions. There is evidence these classes form canonical circuit motifs that depend primarily on their identity; however, regional cues likely also influence their choice of synaptic partners. We mined the Allen Institute's single-cell RNA-sequencing database of mouse cortical neurons to study the expression of genes necessary for synaptic connectivity and physiology in two regions: the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the primary visual cortex (VISp). We used the Allen's metadata to parse cells by clusters representing major excitatory and inhibitory classes that are common to both ALM and VISp. We then performed two types of pairwise differential gene expression analysis: (1) between different neuronal classes within the same brain region (ALM or VISp), and (2) between the same neuronal class in ALM and VISp. We filtered our results for differentially expressed genes related to circuit connectivity and developed a novel bioinformatic approach to determine the sets uniquely enriched in each neuronal class in ALM, VISp, or both. This analysis provides an organized set of genes that may regulate synaptic connectivity and physiology in a cell-type-specific manner. Furthermore, it identifies candidate mechanisms for circuit organization that are conserved across functionally distinct cortical regions or that are region dependent. Finally, we used the SFARI Human Gene Module to identify genes from this analysis that are related to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our analysis provides clear molecular targets for future studies to understand neocortical circuit organization and abnormalities that underlie autistic phenotypes."

It is a significant problem emerging worldwide, as one in 100 children is affected by this disorder globally. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) along with the expression analysis of regulatory genes. Functional enrichment analysis was an integral part of current findings to notify the significant pathways of this complex disorder. The study was conducted with two RNA-Seq datasets, viz., GSE64018 and GSE62098, for ASD patients and control samples from the GEO database. The identification of up-regulatory and down-regulatory genes was performed by the interaction analysis of transcription factors (TF) and DEGs. As an outcome of the meta-analysis, 2543 DEGs were identified as common across both of the datasets in which 1402 DEGs exhibited upregulation and 1130 genes have shown downregulation. In network analysis, upregulatory genes have shown strong interaction while downregulatory genes exhibit weak or null interaction. Further, in the enrichment analysis of screened upregulatory DEGs, three major significant pathways were identified namely the ATP synthesis pathway, FAS signaling pathway, and the Huntington's disease pathway. The common expression of CYC 1 gene in all the identified pathways has indicated that it is an important key regulator gene for the majorly associated pathways. The study concludes that all the potential DEGs were found to show their related high expression in neurobiological regulations specifically with ASD.Communicated by Ramaswamy S. Sarma."
36406395,Effect of stigma maydis polysaccharide on the gut microbiota and transcriptome of VPA induced autism model rats.,2022,Front Microbiol,10.3389/fmicb.2022.1009502,"Stigma maydis polysaccharide (SMPS) is a plant polysaccharide that participates in immune regulation and gastrointestinal motility. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders, and ASD patients often present intestinal microflora imbalance problems; however, there is no effective treatment method. This study explores the effect of SMPS intervention on the gut microbiota in autism model rats as well as the potential action pathways. Female Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with sodium valproic acid (VPA) or normal saline at embryonic day 12.5 to establish an autism model or normal control in their offspring. The offspring prenatally exposed to VPA were randomly assigned to the VPA and the SMPS groups. The SMPS group was administered SMPS from E0.5 to postnatal day (PND) 21. We performed 16S rRNA and transcriptomics analyses to reveal the gut microbiota (GM) and differentially expressed genes in the autism model rats in response to SMPS intervention. SMPS intervention significantly improved the diversity and structure of the GM in autism model rats compared with the VPA rats. Moreover, the relative abundance of "

Accumulating literature implicates the immune system in NDDs, and transcriptomics of post-mortem brain tissue has revealed an inflammatory signal. We interrogated two RNA-sequencing datasets of ASD and TS and identified differentially expressed genes, to explore commonly enriched pathways through GO, KEGG, and Reactome.

36688057,The Issue of Monocyte Activation in ASD: Troubles with Translation.,2022,J Cell Immunol,10.33696/immunology.4.146,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased year on year for the past two decades and currently affects 1 in 44 individuals in the US. An increasing number of studies have pointed to increased immune activation as both an etiological agent and also involved in the ongoing pathological process of ASD. Both adaptive and innate immune responses have been implicated. Evidence of innate dysregulation has so far included increased production of innate inflammatory cytokines, increased cell numbers, and altered activation in monocytes in the blood and microglia in the brain. Suggesting an orchestrated innate immune response may be involved in ASD. Hughes et al. (2022) recently assessed transcriptome differences that could underlie altered activation of monocytes using next-generation bulk-RNA sequencing on isolated CD14+ monocytes at baseline and after activation with different Toll-like receptor agonists. Circulating CD14+ monocyte from children with autistic disorder (AD) and children diagnosed with perverse developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) were found to differ in a number of activation pathways after gene enrichment analysis compared to typically developing children. There was an overall upregulation in translational machinery in both neurodevelopmental disorder groups, whereas typically developing children were downregulated, indicating an issue with monocyte activation. Several identified differentially expressed genes in monocytes were also identified as ASD at-risk genes, according to the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), and genes involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. This work implicates altered monocyte activation with a lack of regulation as a potential mechanistic issue in ASD. Future work is warranted to evaluate how monocyte regulatory mechanisms differ in ASD individuals."
37041460,Single-nucleus gene and gene set expression-based similarity network fusion identifies autism molecular subtypes.,2023,BMC Bioinformatics,10.1186/s12859-023-05278-0,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. With the accumulation of biological sequencing data, more and more studies shift to molecular subtype-first approach, from identifying molecular subtypes based on genetic and molecular data to linking molecular subtypes with clinical manifestation, which can reduce heterogeneity before phenotypic profiling.
RESULTS: In this study, we perform similarity network fusion to integrate gene and gene set expression data of multiple human brain cell types for ASD molecular subtype identification. Then we apply subtype-specific differential gene and gene set expression analyses to study expression patterns specific to molecular subtypes in each cell type. To demonstrate the biological and practical significance, we analyze the molecular subtypes, investigate their correlation with ASD clinical phenotype, and construct ASD molecular subtype prediction models.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified molecular subtype-specific gene and gene set expression may be used to differentiate ASD molecular subtypes, facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of ASD. Our method provides an analytical pipeline for the identification of molecular subtypes and even disease subtypes of complex disorders."
37381037,Exploratory analysis of L1 retrotransposons expression in autism﻿.,2023,Mol Autism,10.1186/s13229-023-00554-5,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental diseases whose genetic etiology is not completely understood. Several investigations have relied on transcriptome analysis from peripheral tissues to dissect ASD into homogenous molecular phenotypes. Recently, analysis of changes in gene expression from postmortem brain tissues has identified sets of genes that are involved in pathways previously associated with ASD etiology. In addition to protein-coding transcripts, the human transcriptome is composed by a large set of non-coding RNAs and transposable elements (TEs). Advancements in sequencing technologies have proven that TEs can be transcribed in a regulated fashion, and their dysregulation might have a role in brain diseases.
METHODS: We exploited published datasets comprising RNA-seq data from (1) postmortem brain of ASD subjects, (2) in vitro cell cultures where ten different ASD-relevant genes were knocked out and (3) blood of discordant siblings. We measured the expression levels of evolutionarily young full-length transposable L1 elements and characterized the genomic location of deregulated L1s assessing their potential impact on the transcription of ASD-relevant genes. We analyzed every sample independently, avoiding to pool together the disease subjects to unmask the heterogeneity of the molecular phenotypes.
RESULTS: We detected a strong upregulation of intronic full-length L1s in a subset of postmortem brain samples and in in vitro differentiated neurons from iPSC knocked out for ATRX. L1 upregulation correlated with an high number of deregulated genes and retained introns. In the anterior cingulate cortex of one subject, a small number of significantly upregulated L1s overlapped with ASD-relevant genes that were significantly downregulated, suggesting the possible existence of a negative effect of L1 transcription on host transcripts.
LIMITATIONS: Our analyses must be considered exploratory and will need to be validated in bigger cohorts. The main limitation is given by the small sample size and by the lack of replicates for postmortem brain samples. Measuring the transcription of locus-specific TEs is complicated by the repetitive nature of their sequence, which reduces the accuracy in mapping sequencing reads to the correct genomic locus.
CONCLUSIONS: L1 upregulation in ASD appears to be limited to a subset of subjects that are also characterized by a general deregulation of the expression of canonical genes and an increase in intron retention. In some samples from the anterior cingulate cortex, L1s upregulation seems to directly impair the expression of some ASD-relevant genes by a still unknown mechanism. L1s upregulation may therefore identify a group of ASD subjects with common molecular features and helps stratifying individuals for novel strategies of therapeutic intervention."

37807181,Dissection of cellular disruptions in autism spectrum disorder comorbidities.,2023,Eur J Neurosci,10.1111/ejn.16155,"Up to 80% of children with autism spectrum disorder have at least one other neuropsychiatric comorbidity. The causes of such disorders are highly genetic, yet many studies fail to take analysis further than risk gene discovery to see cellular and mechanistic changes occurring. Therefore, the goal of this study was to unveil novel gene expression signatures involved in important neurodevelopmental processes that, when disrupted, lead to each of the autism comorbidities of interest. We achieved this by analysing a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset with prefrontal cortex samples from autism spectrum disorder plus comorbidities for differentially expressed genes. The highest number of alterations was seen in excitatory neurons, which also showed differential population and cell-cell interactions across disorders and an increase in expression of genes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways. Interestingly, the group without comorbidities displayed an increase in neuron-neuron interactions yet a decrease in population number, suggesting a major rewiring of neuronal connections. Further analysis of the topmost significant genes from this cell type in developing prefrontal cortex datasets revealed interesting expression trajectories corresponding to important time points during corticogenesis. This further identified four novel candidate genes that show a potential link to developmental pathways that may contribute to autism and its comorbidities when dysregulated. The study provides a better understanding of co-occurring conditions at a transcriptomic and cell-type level and thereby aid future research in providing earlier diagnosis, care and intervention."
38594551,Exploring key genes and pathways associated with sex differences in autism spectrum disorder: integrated bioinformatic analysis.,2024,Mamm Genome,10.1007/s00335-024-10036-5,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder marked by functional abnormalities in brain that causes social and linguistic difficulties. The incidence of ASD is more prevalent in males compared to females, but the underlying mechanism, as well as molecular indications for identifying sex-specific differences in ASD symptoms remain unknown. Thus, impacting the development of personalized strategy towards pharmacotherapy of ASD. The current study employs an integrated bioinformatic approach to investigate the genes and pathways uniquely associated with sex specific differences in autistic individuals. Based on microarray dataset (GSE6575) extracted from the gene expression omnibus, the dysregulated genes between the autistic and the neurotypical individuals for both sexes were identified. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to ascertain biological activities linked to the dysregulated genes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis was carried out to identify hub genes. The identified hub genes were examined to determine their functions and involvement in the associated pathways using Enrichr. Additionally, hub genes were validated from autism-associated databases and the potential small molecules targeting the hub genes were identified. The present study utilized whole blood transcriptomic gene expression analysis data and identified 2211 and 958 differentially expressed unique genes in males and females respectively. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that male hub genes were functionally associated with RNA polymerase II mediated transcriptional regulation whereas female hub genes were involved in intracellular signal transduction and cell migration. The top male hub genes exhibited functional enrichment in tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. The pathway enrichment analysis of male hub genes indicates the enrichment of papillomavirus infection. Female hub genes were enriched in androgen receptor signalling pathway and functionally enriched in focal adhesion specific excision repair. Identified drug like candidates targeting these genes may serve as a potential sex specific therapeutics. Wortmannin for males, 5-Fluorouracil for females had the highest scores. Targeted and sex-specific pharmacotherapies may be created for the management of ASD. The current investigation identifies sex-specific molecular signatures derived from whole blood which may serve as a potential peripheral sex-specific biomarkers for ASD. The study also uncovers the possible pharmacological interventions against the selected genes/pathway, providing support in development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate ASD. However, experimental proofs on biological systems are warranted."
38750585,"Sex-specific impacts of prenatal bisphenol A exposure on genes associated with cortical development, social behaviors, and autism in the offspring's prefrontal cortex.",2024,Biol Sex Differ,10.1186/s13293-024-00614-2,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that prenatal BPA exposure altered the transcriptome profiles of autism-related genes in the offspring's hippocampus, disrupting hippocampal neuritogenesis and causing male-specific deficits in learning. However, the sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the developing prefrontal cortex, which is another brain region highly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have not been investigated.
METHODS: We obtained transcriptome data from RNA sequencing analysis of the prefrontal cortex of male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA or control and reanalyzed. BPA-responsive genes associated with cortical development and social behaviors were selected for confirmation by qRT-PCR analysis. Neuritogenesis of primary cells from the prefrontal cortex of pups prenatally exposed to BPA or control was examined. The social behaviors of the pups were assessed using the two-trial and three-chamber tests. The male-specific impact of the downregulation of a selected BPA-responsive gene (i.e., Sema5a) on cortical development in vivo was interrogated using siRNA-mediated knockdown by an in utero electroporation technique.
RESULTS: Genes disrupted by prenatal BPA exposure were associated with ASD and showed sex-specific dysregulation. Sema5a and Slc9a9, which were involved in neuritogenesis and social behaviors, were downregulated only in males, while Anxa2 and Junb, which were also linked to neuritogenesis and social behaviors, were suppressed only in females. Neuritogenesis was increased in males and showed a strong inverse correlation with Sema5a and Slc9a9 expression levels, whereas, in the females, neuritogenesis was decreased and correlated with Anxa2 and Junb levels. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sema5a in males also impaired cortical development in utero. Consistent with Anxa2 and Junb downregulations, deficits in social novelty were observed only in female offspring but not in males.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that prenatal BPA exposure dysregulated the expression of ASD-related genes and functions, including cortical neuritogenesis and development and social behaviors, in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that, besides the hippocampus, BPA could also exert its adverse effects through sex-specific molecular mechanisms in the offspring's prefrontal cortex, which in turn would lead to sex differences in ASD-related neuropathology and clinical manifestations, which deserves further investigation."

What drives these changes and how they relate to genetic susceptibility in this complex condition are not well understood. We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain."
